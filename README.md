**Objective**
The objective of this program is to program an Arduino board to blink an LED at a specific interval, thereby introducing concepts of embedded systems programming and hardware interfacing.

**Key Activities**

**1.Setting Up the Arduino Environment:**
  Install the Arduino IDE and configure the Arduino board and USB drivers.<br>
**2.Writing the Code:**
  Initialize the digital pin connected to the LED,write the setup() function to set the pin mode and write the loop() function to turn the LED on and off at regular intervals. <br>
**3.Uploading the Code to the Arduino:**
  Connect the Arduino to the computer via USB,compile and upload the code using the Arduino IDE.<br>
**4.Observing the LED Blink:**
  Verify that the LED blinks at the specified interval.

**Technologies Used**

**1.Arduino Board:** Any model(e.g.,Arduino Uno).<br>
**2.Arduino IDE:** For writing,compiling,and uploading code.<br>
**3.C++:** Programming language used for writing the code.<br>
**4.Digital I/O:** Basic concept of controlling digital pins on the Arduino.<br>

**key insights**
<head>
Introduction to Embedded Systems<head>: This project serves as an introductory exercise in embedded systems, helping users understand the fundamental concept of using microcontrollers to control hardware.<br>
Hands-On Experience with Arduino: By working with the Arduino board and IDE, users gain practical experience in setting up and programming a microcontroller platform that is widely used in both educational and prototyping environments.<br>
Basic Digital I/O Understanding: The project demonstrates how to use digital input/output pins to control an LED, providing a foundational understanding of how microcontrollers interact with hardware components.<br>
Importance of Code Structure: The separation of the setup() and loop() functions in the Arduino sketch teaches users the importance of initialization and continuous execution in embedded programming.<br>
Delay Function and Timing Control: The use of the delay() function introduces the concept of timing control in embedded systems, showing how to create pauses between actions to achieve desired behavior (e.g., blinking at 1-second intervals).
